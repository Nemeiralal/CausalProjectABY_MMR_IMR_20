# CausalProjectABY_MMR_IMR_20
Study of causal effects of Ayushman Bharat Heallth Scheme on IMR and MMR in Indian states which adopted the scheme in 2018.
Paper to study causal effect of Republic of India's federal health scheme called "Ayushman Bharat Yojana" (ABY) which allows citizens below a certain income level to get free health insurance and avail health care at private facilities at no cost. 
Scheme implemented in September 2018.
Out of 36 states, four did not choose to adopt it, presenting a natural experimental setting to study causal effect of scheme on health outcomes in treated states. Health outcomes studied are MMR (Maternal Mortality Rate) and IMR (Infant Mortality Rate) using Diff-in-diff and Triple differencing estimators on three years unbalanced panel data, using two-way state and year fixed effects.
Wild cluster bootstrap is used to adjust p values as the number of groups is just 36. Clustered standard errors used.

Overall, since this new scheme is a health benefit scheme, which gives free access to better health facilities to those who can ill afford these otherwise, the treatment is expected to give better health outcomes in states which adopted the scheme. That must translate into reduction in Infant and maternal mortality rates in treatment states compared to control states. The coefficients on DD and DDD parameters are anticipated to be negative, and statistically significant.
